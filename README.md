## Stakeholders

Stakeholder
- Name: Sultan
- Role/ who they are: senior CS student at NYIT. Currently in a lot of study groups and group projects, working on his senior project this semester with 6 other classmates.
- Date interviewed: 9/16

Goals / needs:
- easily propose a group meet up session fast with 2-5 time options
- share a simple code or link that anyone can join (no account)
- See everyone's selections on one screen
- get a clear "winning time" to lock and share
- Mobile flow that is quick for first time users

Problems / frustrations:
- chat messages like discord get buried and confusing to keep up with
- Late replies and unclear emoji reactions
- Hard to compare availability without manual tallying
- Picking a time that later misses someone's availability
- Time-zone difference adds confusion

## Product Vision Statement

GroupMeets is a simple mobile app where an organizer proposes 2â€“5 time slots, and share a link or code then friends vote on what works, and the organizer confirms the best study-session time quickly.
